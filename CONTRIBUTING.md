## About to create a new Github Issue?

We appreciate that. But before you do, please learn our basic rules:

* This is not a support forum. If you have a question, please go to [The Cukes Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/cukes).
* Do you have an idea for a new feature? Then don't expect it to be implemented unless you or someone else sends a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). You might be better to start a discussion on [the google group](http://groups.google.com/group/cukes).
* Reporting a bug? Please tell us:
  * which version of Cucumber you're using
  * which version of Ruby you're using.
  * How to reproduce it. Bugs with a failing test in a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) get fixed much quicker. Some bugs may never be fixed.
* Want to paste some code or output? Put \`\`\` on a line above and below your code/output. See [GFM](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)'s *Fenced Code Blocks* for details.
* We love [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). But if you don't have a test to go with it we probably won't merge it.

# Contributing to Cucumber

This document is a guide for those maintaining Cucumber, and others who would like to submit patches.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project. Make a branch for your change.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Make sure your patch is well covered by tests. We don't accept changes to Cucumber that aren't tested.
* Please do not change the Rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
  bump version in a commit by itself so we can ignore when we merge your change)
* Send us a pull request.

## Running tests

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake

## Release Process

* Bump the version number in `lib/cucumber/platform.rb`.
* Make sure `History.md` is updated with the upcoming version number, and has entries for all fixes.
* No need to add a `History.md` header at this point - this should be done when a new change is made, later.
* Make sure you have up-to-date and clean copy of cucumber/cucumber.github.com.git at the same level as cucumber repo.

Now release it

    bundle update
    bundle exec rake
    git commit -m "Release X.Y.Z"
    rake release

## Gaining Release Karma
