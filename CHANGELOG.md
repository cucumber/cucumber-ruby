## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added a new option for running order `--reverse` which will run the scenarios in reverse order ([#1807](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1807) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

## [10.2.0] - 2025-12-10
### Changed
- Permit the latest version of the `cucumber-html-formatter` (v22.0.0+)
- Permit `cucumber-expressions` up to v19

## [10.1.1] - 2025-10-08
### Changed
- Internal refactors to CCK testing code to better check that the message formatter responses are as expected
- Simplify `#attach` by better checking the different use cases (base64 vs file path)

### Fixed
- Prevent messages (And any consuming formatters), from not handling unknown (base64), media types ([#1796](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1796) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

## [10.1.0] - 2025-08-20
### Changed
- Updated `cucumber-compatibility-kit` to v20
- Optimised `compatibility` tests (That use the CCK), so that tests run slightly more optimal (Creating less empty arrays)

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the html-formatter wasn't respecting the new structure for `StackTrace` cucumber messages ([#1790](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1790) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

## [10.0.0] - 2025-06-11
### Changed
- Added dependencies that will no longer be part of the ruby stdlib ([jeromeag](https://github.com/jerome))
- NB: This change has also facilitated a tweak to some output messages to include new fields such as `testRunStartedId`
for full changes and expectations of what will be new check the [messages](https://github.com/cucumber/messages/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2700---2024-10-26)
([luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))
- Updated `cucumber-compatibility-kit` to v18
- Changed compatibility testing to fully lean on external assets instead of duplicating them ([luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))
- Permit usage of latest versions of all cucumber internal gems
- The auto-generation of all placeholder `pending` steps has been refactored (_There should be no visible changes
but the code is now refactored to work using newer ruby standards_)
- The `#text?` method for checking Differences in multi-line text is now deprecated (Users
should lean on an appropriate testing library for this)
- `Cucumber.use_legacy_autoloader` that was intended as a stop-gap for v4/v5 is now deprecated (People
that need to rely on procedural loading / reloading of files should use method invocations) ([luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))
- The backtrace filtering logic has been changed (_There should be no visible changes but the code is now
refactored to use newer, less procedural ruby_)

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where a change to one example in compatibility testing wasn't fully adhered to ([luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))
- Fixed Ruby 3.4+ issue where error backtraces weren't being formatted. ([#1771](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1771) [orien](https://github.com/orien))
- Fix some problematic specs that were leaking state and showcasing an issue on JRuby ([#1783](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1783) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

### Removed
- `StepDefinitionLight` associated methods. The class itself is present but deprecated
- `Webrick` Proc handling aliases that were long redundant
- Associated legacy scripts for updating dependencies that are no longer used
- Tag Expressions using legacy syntax that were handled / sanitized are no longer done so
(This applies to both regular usage and internal testing)
- Removed support for Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 (Minimum ruby is now 3.1) ([luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))
- Unindentation support for snippet generator / tests (Heredocs are much better now) ([luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

## [9.2.0] - 2024-03-19
### Changed
- Updated cucumber dependencies (Specifically cucumber-core) ([luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

([#1752](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1750) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

(This fixes an issue in cucumber-wire when passing legacy steps down the wire)
([#1746](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1746) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

## [9.1.1] - 2024-01-04

- Fixed most of the `Layout` cop offenses ([luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

### Removed
- The sample sinatra tests are no longer used in internal testing (This removes a bunch of superfluous dev gems) ([#1743](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1743) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

([#1738](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1738) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))
- `ParameterType` message now contains a new (sourceReference), property
(This contains a uri string and a `Location` message -> for where the ParameterType `transformer` is located) ([#1738](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1738) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))
- `#attach` now can take an optional filename parameter which will rename attachments like PDF's
([#1738](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1738) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

### Fixed
- Clear up a couple of tiny "nuances" that hide lots of issues when running local vs remote (Primarily CCK tests should always be runnable)
([#1738](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1738) [luke-hill](https://github.com/luke-hill))

### Removed
- `AfterConfiguration` has been removed. Please use `InstallPlugin` or `BeforeAll` instead.
See upgrading notes for [8.0.0.md](upgrading_notes/8.0.0.md#upgrading-to-800) to update your code accordingly.
([#1591](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1591))
- The built-in Wire protocol
The Wire protocol is still officially supported, but as an optional plugin rather
than a built-in feature. See upgrading notes for [8.0.0.md](upgrading_notes/8.0.0.md#upgrading-to-800) to update your code accordingly.
- Removed former unused `stdin` argument from `Cli::Main`. That may impact your code
if you use cucumber API `Cucumber::Cli::Main`. See upgrading notes for [8.0.0.md](upgrading_notes/8.0.0.md#upgrading-to-800).
([#1588](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/pull/1588))
- Removed `DataTable#map_column!` and `DataTable#map_headers!`.
Those methods were error-prone and planned to be removed a long time ago. You
can use the immutable versions instead: `DataTable#map_column` and
`DataTable#map_headers`.
