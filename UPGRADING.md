# Upgrading to 8.0.0

# The wire protocol

The built-in wire protocol has been removed.

The wire protocol is still available by explicitly using the `cucumber-wire` gem.

### Before cucumber 8.0.0

Before cucumber 8.0.0, the wire protocol was automatically installed with cucumber,
and automatically activated when it had detected a `.wire` file.

If you were using cucumber 7.1.0 and did not already migrate your code, you had a
deprecation message.

### With cucumber 8.0.0

If you are not using the wire protocol, you have nothing to do.

If you already have updated your code to remove the deprecation message shown when
using cucumber 7.1.0, you are already up-to-date. Nothing more has to be done.

If you are still using the built-in wire protocol here the step to migrate to cucumber 8.0.0:

- add the gem `cucumber-wire` to your Gemfile alongside the `cucumber` one, and install it:
  ```ruby
  # Gemfile

  # ...

  gem "cucumber"
  gem "cucumber-wire"

  # ...

  ```
  ```shell
  bundle install
  ```
- add `require 'cucumber/wire'` in your support code. If you do not have support
  code yet, create a new one. For example `features/support/wire.rb`.
  ```ruby
  # features/support/wire.rb
  require 'cucumber/wire'
  ```

## `Cucumber::Cli::Main` former `stdin` argument

The second argument of `Cucumber::Cli::Main` - which was formerly named `stdin` -
has been removed.

### Before cucumber 8.0.0

You would have used `Cucumber::Cli::Main` with a dummy parameter:

```ruby
Cucumber::Cli::Main.new(
      argument_list,
      nil, # <-- this is a former unused `stdin` parameter
      @stdout,
      @stderr,
      @kernel
).execute!
```

### With cucumber 8.0.0

The argument has been removed from the initializer so the dummy parameter is not
required anymore:

```ruby
Cucumber::Cli::Main.new(
      argument_list,
      @stdout,
      @stderr,
      @kernel
).execute!
```

# Upgrading to 7.1.0

## The wire protocol

Usage of built-in wire protocol with `cucumber-ruby` will be deprecated in cucumber
7.1.0, and removed in cucumber 8.0.0.

The wire protocol will still be available by explicitly using the `cucumber-wire`
gem.

### Before cucumber 7.1.0

Before cucumber 7.1.0, the wire protocol was automatically installed with cucumber,
and automatically activated when it had detected a `.wire` file.

### With cucumber 7.1.0

The wire protocol will work as before, but you will notice a deprecation message.

To prevent the deprecation message to be shown, add the gem `cucumber-wire` to your
Gemfile alongside the `cucumber` one, and install it:

```ruby
# Gemfile

# ...

gem "cucumber"
gem "cucumber-wire"

# ...

```
```shell
bundle install
```

And add `require 'cucumber/wire'` in your support code. If you do not have support
code yet, create a new one. For example `features/support/wire.rb`.

```ruby
# features/support/wire.rb
require 'cucumber/wire'
```

The wire protocol will be installed, and no deprecation message will be shown anymore.

## AfterConfiguration hook

Usage of `AfterConfiguration` hook will be deprecated in 7.1.0.

Use the new `InstallPlugin` hook if you need the `configuration` parameter.

Use the new `BeforeAll` hook if you don't need the `configuration` parameter.

More information about hooks can be found in [features/docs/writing_support_code/hooks/README.md](./features/docs/writing_support_code/hooks/README.md).
