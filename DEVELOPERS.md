# Contributing to Cucumber

This document is a guide for those maintaining Cucumber, and others who would like to submit patches.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project. Make a branch for your change.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Make sure your patch is well covered by tests. We don't accept changes to Cucumber that aren't tested.
* Please do not change the Rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
  bump version in a commit by itself so we can ignore when we merge your change)
* Send us a pull request.

## Running tests

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake

## Release Process

Before you even attempt to do a release, make sure you can log into cukes.info and touch a file in /var/www/cucumber/api/ruby (see gem_tasks/yard.rake). You need to be able to do this in order to upload YARD docs as part of the release.

* Bump the version number in `lib/cucumber/platform.rb`.
* Make sure `History.md` is updated with the upcoming version number, and has entries for all fixes.
* No need to add a `History.md` header at this point - this should be done when a new change is made, later.

Now release it

    bundle update
    rake
    git commit -m "Release X.Y.Z"
    rake release
