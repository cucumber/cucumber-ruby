Feature: Raketask
  In order to use cucumber's rake task
  As a Cuker
  I do not want to see rake's backtraces when it fails
  Also I want to get zero exit status code on failures
  And non-zero exit status code when is pases

        end
      """

  Scenario: Passing feature
    When I run `bundle exec rake pass`
    Then the exit status should be 0

  Scenario: Failing feature
    When I run `bundle exec rake fail`
    Then the exit status should not be 0
    And the output should not contain "rake aborted!"
