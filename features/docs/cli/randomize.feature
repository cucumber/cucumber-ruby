Feature: Randomize

  Use the `--order random` switch to run scenarios in random order.

  This is especially helpful for detecting situations where you have state
  leaking between scenarios, which can cause flickering or fragile tests.

  If you do find a random run that exposes dependencies between your tests,
  you can reproduce that run by using the seed that's printed at the end of
  the test run.

  For a given seed, the order of scenarios is constant, i.e. if step A runs
  before step B, it will always run before step B even if other steps are
  skipped.
