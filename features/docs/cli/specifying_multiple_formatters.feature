Feature: Running multiple formatters

  When running cucumber, you are able to using multiple different
  formatters and redirect the output to text files.
  Two formatters cannot both print to the same file (or to STDOUT)

  Background:
    Given a file named "features/test.feature" with:
    """
    Feature: Lots of undefined

      Scenario: Implement me
        Given it snows in Sahara
        Given it's 40 degrees in Norway
        And it's 40 degrees in Norway
        When I stop procrastinating
        And there is world peace

  Scenario: Multiple formatters and outputs
    When I run `cucumber --no-color --format progress --out progress.txt --format pretty --out pretty.txt --no-source --dry-run --no-snippets features/test.feature`
    Then the stderr should not contain anything
    Then the file "progress.txt" should contain:
