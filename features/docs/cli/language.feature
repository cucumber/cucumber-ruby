Feature: Specifying a different spoken language for runs

  An

    -L, --language LANGUAGE

  option that allows users to switch to a different language
  without adding a language header to each feature file

  Scenario: An unknown language specified
    Given an empty file named "features/whatever.feature"
    When I run `cucumber --language foo`
    Then it should fail with:
      """
      Sorry, we don't recognize this language.

      Try 'cucumber --i18n help', and look up the abbreviation
      of the language you want to use in the list.

  Scenario: Specified language agrees with the language in use
