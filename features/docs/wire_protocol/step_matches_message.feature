Feature: Step matches message

  When the features have been parsed, Cucumber will send a `step_matches`
  message to ask the wire server if it can match a step name. This happens for
  each of the steps in each of the features.

  The wire server replies with an array of StepMatch objects.

  When each StepMatch is returned, it contains the following data:

  * `id` - identifier for the step definition to be used later when if it
  needs to be invoked. The identifier can be any string value and
  is simply used for the wire server's own reference.
  * `args` - any argument values as captured by the wire end's own regular
  expression (or other argument matching) process.

    Optionally, the StepMatch can also contain a source reference, and a native
    regexp string which will be used by some formatters.
