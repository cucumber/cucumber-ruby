Feature: Invoke message

  Assuming a StepMatch was returned for a given step name, when it's time to
  invoke that step definition, Cucumber will send an invoke message.

  The invoke message contains the ID of the step definition, as returned by
  the wire server in response to the the step_matches call, along with the
  arguments that were parsed from the step name during the same step_matches
  call.

  The wire server will normally reply one of the following:

  * `success`
  * `fail`
  * `pending` - optionally takes a message argument

  This isn't quite the whole story: see also table_diffing.feature

    If an invoked step definition fails, it can return details of the exception

  Scenario: Invoke a step definition which takes string arguments (and passes)

    If the step definition at the end of the wire captures arguments, these are
    communicated back to Cucumber in the `step_matches` message.

    Cucumber expects these StepArguments to be returned in the StepMatch. The keys
    have the following meanings:

    - `val` - the value of the string captured for that argument from the step
      name passed in step_matches
    - `pos` - the position within the step name that the argument was matched
      (used for formatter highlighting)

    The argument values are then sent back by Cucumber in the `invoke` message.
