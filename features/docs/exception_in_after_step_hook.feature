Feature: Exception in AfterStep Block
  In order to use custom assertions at the end of each step
  As a developer
  I want exceptions raised in AfterStep blocks to be handled gracefully and reported by the formatters

  Background:
    Given the standard step definitions
    And a file named "features/step_definitions/naughty_steps.rb" with:
      """
      Given /^this step does something naughty$/ do x=1
        @naughty = true
      end
      """
    And a file named "features/support/env.rb" with:
      """
      class NaughtyStepException < Exception; end
      AfterStep do
        if @naughty
          raise NaughtyStepException.new("This step has been very very naughty")
        end
      end
