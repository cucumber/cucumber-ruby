Feature: Cucumber --work-in-progress switch
  In order to ensure that feature scenarios do not pass until they are expected to
  Developers should be able to run cucumber in a mode that
            - will fail if any scenario passes completely
            - will not fail otherwise

  Background: A passing and a pending feature
    Given the standard step definitions
    And a file named "features/wip.feature" with:
