Feature: Assertions

  Assertions are how you tell Cucumber that a step has failed. The most basic
  way to do this is by raising an exception, but you can also use Ruby's built-in
  `MiniTest::Unit` or `Test::Unit` assertions library, the `minitest` gem with
  assertions in `Minitest::Assertions` or RSpec's `RSpec::Expectations` library.
