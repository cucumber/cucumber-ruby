Feature: Ambiguous Steps

  When Cucumber searches for a step definition for a step, it might find multiple step
  definitions that could match. In that case, it will give you an error that the step
  definitions are ambiguous.

  You can also use a `--guess` mode, where it uses magic powers to try and figure
  out which of those two step definitions is most likely to be the one you meant it
  to use. Use it with caution!
