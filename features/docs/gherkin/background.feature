Feature: Background

  Often you find that several scenarios in the same feature start with 
  a common context.
  
  Cucumber provides a mechanism for this, by providing a `Background` keyword
  where you can specify steps that should be run before each scenario in the
  feature. Typically these will be `Given` steps, but you can use any steps
  that you need to.
  
  **Hint:** if you find that some of the scenarios don't fit the background,
  consider splitting them into a separate feature.
