Feature: Rerun formatter

  The rerun formatter writes an output that's perfect for
  passing to Cucumber when you want to rerun only the 
  scenarios that prevented the exit code to be zero.

  You can save off the rerun output to a file by using it like this:

  `cucumber -f rerun --out .cucumber.rerun`

  Now you can pass that file's content to Cucumber to tell it
  which scenarios to run:

  `cucumber \`cat .cucumber.rerun\``

  This is useful when debugging in a large suite of features.
