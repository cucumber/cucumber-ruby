Feature: Debug formatter

  In order to help you easily visualise the listener API, you can use
  the `debug` formatter that prints the calls to the listener as a
  feature is run.

  Background:
    Given the standard step definitions

  Scenario: title
    Given a file named "features/test.feature" with:

    When I run `cucumber -f debug`
    Then the stderr should not contain anything
    Then it should pass with:
