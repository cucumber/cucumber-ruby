== 0.1.12 2008-12-04

This is the "getting serious with IronRuby release" - largely based on 
"Patrick Gannon":http://www.patrickgannon.net/archive/2008/10/23/bdd-style-feature-tests-using-ironruby-and-rspeccucumber.aspx's
blog entry.

== New features
* Cucumber works with IronRuby/.NET - http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/ironruby-and-net (Aslak Hellesøy)

== Bugfixes
* Fixed bug which was preventing coloring under Autotest (#111, Alan Larkin)

== Removed features
None

== 0.1.11 2008-12-02

Bugfix release with a couple of minor additional features to the command line options.

=== New features
* Capture output from cucumber in Autotest (Alan Larkin)
* Update cucumber generator to work with latest Webrat (Bryan Helkamp)
* CUCUMBR LIKEZ 2 SPEEK WIF KATS. KTHXBAI (Aimee Daniells)
* Support for dynamically pluggable formatters (#99 Joseph Wilk)

== 0.1.10 2008-11-25

This release mostly has smaller bugfixes. The most significant new feature is how
line numbers are specified. You can now run multiple features at specific lines numbers like this:

  cucumber foo.feature:15 bar.feature:6:45:111

This will run foo.feature at line 15 and bar.feature at line 6, 45 and 111.

* Raise a nice error when encountering step definition without block (#95 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Features written using Ruby where breaking due to missing a line number (#91 Joseph Wilk)
* Directly creating a Table meant the scenario table header was never set which was causing a formatter error (#91 Joseph Wilk)

=== Removed features
* $KCODE='u' is no longer done automatically. Developers should do that explicitly when needed in step definitions or env.rb.
* Step definition without a block being treated as pending (#64 Joseph Wilk)
* The --line option has been removed. Use the new file.feature:line format instead.

== 0.1.9 2008-11-12

With this release Cucumber supports 19 (!) natural languages:

* Arabic
* Chinese Simplified
* Danish
* Dutch
* Estonian
* French
* German
* Italian
* Japanese
* Malay
* Norwegian
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Romanian
* Russian
* Spanish
* Swedish
* Texan
* Welsh

Thanks a lot to everyone who has contributed translations. If you don't see your language here, please
add it: http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/spoken-languages

Main functional changes in this release is "Autotest":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/autotest-integration
support and how multiline strings work in feature files:

  # In your .feature file
  Then I should see
    """
    A string
      that "indents"
    and spans
    several lines
  
    """

  # In your steps.rb file
  Then 'I should see' do |text|
    text.should == "A string\n  that \"indents\"\nand spans\nseveral lines\n"
  end

The triple quotes are used to define the start and end of a string, and it also defines what gets stripped away
in the inside string. If the triple quotes are indented 4 spaces, then the text within will have the 4 first
spaces removed too.

=== New features
* Added --[no-]color option to force color on or off (Peter Jaros)

=== Removed features


== 0.1.8 2008-10-18

This release extends the support for tables. PLEASE NOTE THAT TABLES ARE STILL EXPERIMENTAL.
In previous releases it has been possible to use tables to define "more examples" of a scenario i
n a FIT-style column fixture kind of way. Now you can also use tables as arguments to steps.

Tables used to define more examples after a scenario must now be prefixed. In English it looks like this:

  Feature: Addition
    In order to avoid silly mistakes
    As a math idiot 
    I want to be told the sum of two numbers

    Scenario: Add two numbers
      Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
      And I have entered 70 into the calculator
      When I press add
      Then the result should be 120 on the screen
      And the result class should be Fixnum

    More Examples:
      | input_1 | input_2 | button | output | class  |
      | 20      | 30      | add    | 50     | Fixnum |
      | 2       | 5       | add    | 7      | Fixnum |
      | 0       | 40      | add    | 40     | Fixnum |

Languages that are not updated yet will have to use "More Examples" until we get the translations.

Tables can also be used as arguments to individual steps. In fact, steps now support a single argument 
that can span several lines. This can be a table or a string.

Example:

  Given the following people exist:
    | name  | email           | phone |
    | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
    | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
    | Bryan | bryan@email.org | 456   |
  When I search for email.com
  Then I should see:
    | name  | email           | phone |
    | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
    | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
  And I should see:
    "Some text
    on several lines"

The step definitions for such multiline steps must define an extra block argument for the argument:

  Given /the following people exist:/ do |people_table|
    # people_table is of type Cucumber::Model::Table
    # See RDoc for more info
  end

  Then /I should see:/ do |string|
    # string is a plain old ruby String with leading spaces on each line removed
  end

=== New features
* Added profile formatter. (#35, Joseph Wilk)
* Added support for Chinese Simplified. (Liming Lian)
* Added support for Dutch. (Sjoerd Tieleman)
* Multiline steps are now supported. (#4, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Tables used to define more examples for a scenario must be prefixed "More Examples" (see languages.yml for other languages)
* Show the file and line number for scenarios as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)
* Show the file for the feature as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)
* Show the feature file and line for pending steps as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)

=== Bugfixes
* Fixed speling errors in Spanish (Daniel Cadenas)
* ActionMailer delivery_method should not be set to test (#41, Luke Melia)
* Reverse incorrectly ordered args in webrat select step (#43, David Chelimsky)
* Support comments above the first scenario (#31, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed the HTML Formatter to use actual values for FIT table headers (#30, Joseph Wilk)

=== Removed features
* Removed the /^I go to (.*)$/ step from common_webrat.rb - it's not language agnostic and provides little value.

=== New features
* Added new --out option to make it easier to specify output from Rake and cucumber.yml

== 0.1.7 2008-10-05

This release fixes a few bugs and adds some new features. The most notable features are:

=== Calling steps from steps

Step definitions are a little bit closer to having regular method semantics.
You define them, but now you can also call them from other steps. Here is an
example:

  Given /I am logged in as an (.*) named (.*)$/ do |role, name|
    Given "I am registered as #{role}, #{name}, secret"
    When "I log in with #{name}, secret"
  end
  
  Given /I am registered as (.*), (.*), (.*)/ do |role, name, password|
    # (Code removed for brevity)
  end

  When /I log in with (.*), (.*)/ do |name, password|
    # (Code removed for brevity)
  end

This means that steps can be reused in other steps. The GivenScenario feature achieves a similar
effect (on the scenario level), but this feature is something we're not very happy with, mostly
because it's not parameterisable. Calling steps from steps is.

GivenScenario will still be working several releases, but the plan is to remove it completely in 
the 0.3.0 release.

=== Seeing where a step is defined

Prior to this release it could be hard to find out where the ruby step definition matching
a plain text step is defined. Not anymore! Cucumber will now output this:

  Scenario: Regular numbers
    Given I have entered 3 into the calculator   # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:12
    And I have entered 2 into the calculator     # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:12
    When I press divide                          # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:16
    Then the result should be 1.5 on the screen  # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:20
    And the result class should be Float         # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:24

=== Bugfixes
* Fixed a bug in the command line args being lost when using --profile (#27, Joseph Wilk)
* Fixed a bug in Webrat selects (Tim Glen)
* Fixed parsing of DOS line endings (#2, #28, Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* Steps can be called from other steps (#3, Bryan Helmkamp, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added But keyword to all languages (#21, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added --no-source option to display step definition location next to step text (#26, Joseph Wilk, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added more Webrat steps (#25, Tim Glen)
