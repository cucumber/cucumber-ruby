== 0.2.3 2009-03-30

This release sports 4 updated languages, slightly better help with snippets if you "quote" arguments
in your steps. Windows/JRuby users can enjoy colours and you get some more sugar with Tables.

=== New features
* Added new Then /^I should be on (.+)$/ do |page_name| step (Grant Hollingworth)
* Use skipped_param color for examples table header (#266 Eugene Naydanov)
* Added new Cucumber::Ast::Table#rows_hash method (Torbjørn Vatn)
* Windows/JRuby users can now enjoy colourful output (via http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/ansicolor) (#166 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Ambiguous step errors hint about --guess (unless --guess already on) (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added translation for Slovak (Ahmed Al Hafoudh) 
* Updated translation for Dutch (Bart Zonneveld)
* Updated translation for Italian (Alessandro Baroni)
* Updated translation for Japanese (KAKUTANI Shintaro)

=== Bugfixes
* Fixed step name after step keyword without space (#265 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Backtrace is back in HTML reports

== 0.2.2 2009-03-25

This release includes some minor changes to make Cucumber work with pure Java. Cucumber
has already worked with Java for a while (using JRuby and step definitions in Ruby),
but now you can write step definitions in pure Java!

Check out the Cucumber Java project for more details:
http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber_java/tree/master

== 0.2.1 2009-03-25

This release fixes a few minor bugs and adds a couple of new features.

== Bugfixes
* Fixed Cucumber, and rails controller error handling (#49 Matt Patterson)
* HTML Formatter doesn't work correctly with scenario Outlines. (#260 Aslak Hellesøy)
* After blocks are run in reverse order of registration. (#113 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Snippets are showing 'Ands' (#249 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* Snippets use a regexp and block arguments if the step name has "quoted" arguments. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Cucumber::Ast::Feature#to_sexp includes the file name. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* support/env.rb is not loaded when --dry-run is specified. This is to increase performance. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* New usage formatter. This is the foundation for editor autocompletion and navigation between steps and step definitions. (#209 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Removed features
* -S/--step-definitions option introduced in 0.2.0 is removed. Use --format usage [--dry-run] [--no-color].

== 0.2.0 2009-03-18

This release sports a bunch of new and exciting features, as well a major rewrite of Cucumber's internals. 
The rewrite was done to address technical debt and to have a code base that is easier to evolve and maintain. 

There are some changes to the Gherkin language that breaks backwards compatible with the 0.1.x series. 
Most importantly, "GivenScenario" and "More Examples" no longer exist. See the "Removed features" section 
below for more details on how to use alternatives.

Since the grammar has changed, there are some new keywords. We have to rely on the community
to provide updated translations. This is much easier than before - just update languages.yml.
There is no static code generation anymore. To list all languages:

  cucumber --lang help
  
And to list the keywords for a particular language:

  cucumber --lang en-lol help
  
There are some really awesome new features in this release: Tagging, Autoformatting, automatic 
aliasing of keywords in all languages, full Ruby 1.9 support and improved output 
for multiline arguments are some of the highlights.

== (0.16.4 aslakhellesoy-cucumber gem on GitHub)

Bugfix release.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR RAILS USERS.
The template used to generate your features/support/env.rb has changed. You have to apply a minor change
manually for existing Rails projects when you upgrade to this version. Change this:

  require 'webrat/rspec-rails'

to this:

  require 'webrat/core/matchers'

=== New features
* Finnish translation (Tero Tilus)
* Use Webrat's #contain matcher in generated "I should (not) see" step definitions (Bryan Helmkamp)

== Bugfixes

* Flush output in HTML formatter since JRuby doesnt do it automatically (Diego Carrion)
* Better handling of ARGV (#169 David Chelimsky, Ben Mabey)
* Compatibility with ruby-debug (do ARGV.dup in bin/cucumber so it can restart ruby with same args) (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.16 2009-01-19

This is a small bugfix release. The most notable improvement is compatibility with Webrat 0.4. Rails/Webrat users should
upgrade both Cucumber and Webrat gems.

=== New features
* Allow argument placeholders in step tables and multiline comments (#121 Joseph Wilk)
* Scenario Outline can be followed by several named Examples sections (#123 Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Removed features

== 0.1.15 2009-01-08

Bugfix release

=== New features
* 한국어! (Korean!) (John Hwang)

=== Bugfixes
* --dry-run skips running before/after/steps (#147 Ian Dees)
* Fix a minor bug in the console formatter's summary (David Chelimsky)
* Better quoting of Scenario names in Autotest (Peter Jaros)
* Added some small workarounds for unicode handling on Windows (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.1.14 2009-01-04

This is the first release of Cucumber that runs on Ruby 1.9. There are still some encoding-related issues 
with Arabic (ar), Japanese (ja) and Simplified Chinese (zh-CN). Patches are welcome. Other than that - 
a couple of minor bug fixes and polishing.

=== New features
* Pretty formatter shows number of scenarios (#139 Joseph Wilk)
* Rudimentary support for Ruby 1.9. Now it's ok to file Ruby 1.9-related bugs.

== 0.1.13 2008-12-20

It's time for some new features again. Output is now much better since you can use diffing, tweak
the output colours and get the full --backtrace if you want. Managing your support/* files became 
a little easier since they are now always loaded before the step definitions. Life became easier 
for Windows users in Norway (and other countries using unicode in the features). Plus several other 
bug fixes.

Enjoy!

* Change 'visits' to 'visit' in features generator to comply with new Webrat API (Darius Roberts)

=== Removed features

== 0.1.12 2008-12-04

This is the "getting serious with IronRuby release" - largely based on 
"Patrick Gannon":http://www.patrickgannon.net/archive/2008/10/23/bdd-style-feature-tests-using-ironruby-and-rspeccucumber.aspx's
blog entry.

== New features

== 0.1.10 2008-11-25

This release mostly has smaller bugfixes. The most significant new feature is how
line numbers are specified. You can now run multiple features at specific lines numbers like this:

* Raise a nice error when encountering step definition without block (#95 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Features written using Ruby where breaking due to missing a line number (#91 Joseph Wilk)
* Directly creating a Table meant the scenario table header was never set which was causing a formatter error (#91 Joseph Wilk)

=== Removed features
* $KCODE='u' is no longer done automatically. Developers should do that explicitly when needed in step definitions or env.rb.
* Step definition without a block being treated as pending (#64 Joseph Wilk)
* The --line option has been removed. Use the new file.feature:line format instead.

== 0.1.9 2008-11-12

With this release Cucumber supports 19 (!) natural languages:

* Arabic
* Chinese Simplified
* Danish
* Dutch
* Estonian
* French
* German
* Italian
* Japanese
* Malay
* Norwegian
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Romanian
* Russian
* Spanish
* Swedish
* Texan
* Welsh

Thanks a lot to everyone who has contributed translations. If you don't see your language here, please
add it: http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/spoken-languages

Main functional changes in this release is "Autotest":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis/autotest-integration
support and how multiline strings work in feature files:

  # In your .feature file
  Then I should see
    """
    A string
      that "indents"
    and spans
    several lines
  
    """

  # In your steps.rb file
  Then 'I should see' do |text|
    text.should == "A string\n  that \"indents\"\nand spans\nseveral lines\n"
  end

The triple quotes are used to define the start and end of a string, and it also defines what gets stripped away
in the inside string. If the triple quotes are indented 4 spaces, then the text within will have the 4 first
spaces removed too.

=== New features
* Added --[no-]color option to force color on or off (Peter Jaros)
* Step definition without a block will be treated as pending (#64 Joseph Wilk)
* Added support for Welsh (improvements welcome) (Joseph Wilk)
* Added --quiet option to hide all development aid output when using Pretty formatter (#69 Joseph Wilk)
* Added --no-snippets option to hide snippets for pending steps when using Pretty formatter (#69 Joseph Wilk)

* Renamed common_webrat.rb to webrat_steps.rb (Ben Mabey, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added new feature[:feature_path] task (Roman Gonzalez)
* Added support for Polish (Joseph Wilk)
* Support specifying multiple formatters and multiple outputs (#47 Joseph Wilk)

* Fixing bug where specifying line number 1 in a feature which starts with a scenario with a scenario table was raising an error (#56 Joseph Wilk)

=== Removed features


== 0.1.8 2008-10-18

This release extends the support for tables. PLEASE NOTE THAT TABLES ARE STILL EXPERIMENTAL.
In previous releases it has been possible to use tables to define "more examples" of a scenario i
n a FIT-style column fixture kind of way. Now you can also use tables as arguments to steps.

Tables used to define more examples after a scenario must now be prefixed. In English it looks like this:

  Feature: Addition
    In order to avoid silly mistakes
    As a math idiot 
    I want to be told the sum of two numbers

    Scenario: Add two numbers
      Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
      And I have entered 70 into the calculator
      When I press add
      Then the result should be 120 on the screen

    More Examples:
      | input_1 | input_2 | button | output |
      | 20      | 30      | add    | 50     |
      | 2       | 5       | add    | 7      |
      | 0       | 40      | add    | 40     |

Languages that are not updated yet will have to use "More Examples" until we get the translations.

Tables can also be used as arguments to individual steps. In fact, steps now support a single argument 
that can span several lines. This can be a table or a string.

Example:

  Given the following people exist:
    | name  | email           | phone |
    | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
    | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
    | Bryan | bryan@email.org | 456   |
  When I search for email.com
  Then I should see:
    | name  | email           | phone |
    | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
    | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
  And I should see:
    "Some text
    on several lines"

The step definitions for such multiline steps must define an extra block argument for the argument:

  Given /the following people exist:/ do |people_table|
    # people_table is of type Cucumber::Model::Table
    # See RDoc for more info
  end

  Then /I should see:/ do |string|
    # string is a plain old ruby String with leading spaces on each line removed
  end

=== New features
* Added profile formatter. (#35, Joseph Wilk)
* Added support for Chinese Simplified. (Liming Lian)
* Added support for Dutch. (Sjoerd Tieleman)
* Multiline steps are now supported. (#4, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Tables used to define more examples for a scenario must be prefixed "More Examples" (see languages.yml for other languages)
* Show the file and line number for scenarios as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)
* Show the file for the feature as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)
* Show the feature file and line for pending steps as a comment when displaying with the pretty formatter. (#40, Joseph Wilk)

=== Bugfixes
* Fixed speling errors in Spanish (Daniel Cadenas)
* ActionMailer delivery_method should not be set to test (#41, Luke Melia)
* Reverse incorrectly ordered args in webrat select step (#43, David Chelimsky)
* Support comments above the first scenario (#31, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Fixed the HTML Formatter to use actual values for FIT table headers (#30, Joseph Wilk)

=== Removed features
* Removed the /^I go to (.*)$/ step from common_webrat.rb - it's not language agnostic and provides little value.

=== New features
* Added new --out option to make it easier to specify output from Rake and cucumber.yml

== 0.1.7 2008-10-05

This release fixes a few bugs and adds some new features. The most notable features are:

=== Calling steps from steps

Step definitions are a little bit closer to having regular method semantics.
You define them, but now you can also call them from other steps. Here is an
example:

  Given /I am logged in as an (.*) named (.*)$/ do |role, name|
    Given "I am registered as #{role}, #{name}, secret"
    When "I log in with #{name}, secret"
  end
  
  Given /I am registered as (.*), (.*), (.*)/ do |role, name, password|
    # (Code removed for brevity)
  end

  When /I log in with (.*), (.*)/ do |name, password|
    # (Code removed for brevity)
  end

This means that steps can be reused in other steps. The GivenScenario feature achieves a similar
effect (on the scenario level), but this feature is something we're not very happy with, mostly
because it's not parameterisable. Calling steps from steps is.

GivenScenario will still be working several releases, but the plan is to remove it completely in 
the 0.3.0 release.

=== Seeing where a step is defined

Prior to this release it could be hard to find out where the ruby step definition matching
a plain text step is defined. Not anymore! Cucumber will now output this:

  Scenario: Regular numbers
    Given I have entered 3 into the calculator   # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:12
    And I have entered 2 into the calculator     # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:12
    When I press divide                          # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:16
    Then the result should be 1.5 on the screen  # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:20
    And the result class should be Float         # features/steps/calculator_steps.rb:24

=== Bugfixes
* Fixed a bug in the command line args being lost when using --profile (#27, Joseph Wilk)
* Fixed a bug in Webrat selects (Tim Glen)
* Fixed parsing of DOS line endings (#2, #28, Aslak Hellesøy)

=== New features
* Steps can be called from other steps (#3, Bryan Helmkamp, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added But keyword to all languages (#21, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added --no-source option to display step definition location next to step text (#26, Joseph Wilk, Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added more Webrat steps (#25, Tim Glen)

== 0.1.6 2008-10-01

First gem release!
